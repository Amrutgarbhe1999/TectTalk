        <br>
        <p>Military technology is the application of technology for use in warfare. It comprises the kinds of technology
            that are distinctly military in nature and not civilian in application, usually because they lack useful or
            legal civilian applications, or are dangerous to use without appropriate military training.

            The line is porous; military inventions have been brought into civilian use throughout history, with
            sometimes minor modification if any, and civilian innovations have similarly been put to military use.

            Military technology is often researched and developed by scientists and engineers specifically for use in
            battle by the armed forces. Many new technologies came as a result of the military funding of science.

            Armament engineering is the design, development, testing and lifecycle management of military weapons and
            systems. It draws on the knowledge of several traditional engineering disciplines, including mechanical
            engineering, electrical engineering, mechatronics, electro-optics, aerospace engineering, materials
            engineering, and chemical engineering.

            <p class="lead " style="text-align:justify">Rapid development in military technology had a dramatic impact
                on armies and navies in the industrialized world in 1740-1914. For land warfare, cavalry faded in
                importance, while infantry became transformed by the use of highly accurate more rapidly loading rifles,
                and the use of smokeless powder. Machine guns were developed in the 1860s in Europe. Rocket artillery
                and the Mysorean rockets, both pioneered by Indian Muslim Tipu Sultan, became more powerful as new high
                explosives (based on nitroglycerin) arrived during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, and the French introduced much
                more accurate rapid-fire field artillery. Logistics and communications support for land warfare
                dramatically improved with use of railways and telegraphs. Industrialization provided a base of
                factories that could be converted to produce munitions, as well as uniforms, tents, wagons and essential
                supplies. Medical facilities were enlarged and reorganized based on improved hospitals and the creation
                of modern nursing, typified by Florence Nightingale in Britain during the Crimean War of 1854-56.
