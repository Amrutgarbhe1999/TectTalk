        <br>
        <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) is an extensional term for
            information technology (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications[1] and the integration of
            telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise
            software, middleware, storage, and audiovisual systems, that enable users to access, store, transmit, and
            manipulate information.

            The term ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisual and telephone networks with computer
            networks through a single cabling or link system. There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone
            network with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and
            management. ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television,
            cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and
            appliance with them such as video conferencing and distance learning

            ICT is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving.It covers any product that will store, retrieve,
            manipulate, transmit, or receive information electronically in a digital form (e.g., personal computers,
            digital television, email, or robots). Theoretical differences between interpersonal-communication
            technologies and mass-communication technologies have been identified by the philosopher Piyush Mathur.
            Skills Framework for the Information Age is one of many models for describing and managing competencies for
            ICT professionals for the 21st century.

            <p class="lead " style="text-align:justify">The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
                Organisation (UNESCO), a
                division of the United Nations, has made integrating ICT into education part of its efforts to ensure
                equity
                and access to education. The following, taken directly from a UNESCO publication on educational ICT,
                explains the organization's position on the initiative.

                Information and Communication Technology can contribute to universal access to education, equity in
                education, the delivery of quality learning and teaching, teachers' professional development and more
                efficient education management, governance and administration. UNESCO takes a holistic and comprehensive
                approach to promoting ICT in education. Access, inclusion and quality are among the main challenges they
                can
                address. The Organization's Intersectral Platform for ICT in education focuses on these issues through
                the
                joint work of three of its sectors: Communication & Information, Education and Science.

                Despite the power of computers to enhance and reform teaching and learning practices, improper
                implementation is a widespread issue beyond the reach of increased funding and technological advances
                with
                little evidence that teachers and tutors are properly integrating ICT into everyday learning. Intrinsic
                barriers such as a belief in more traditional teaching practices and individual attitudes towards
                computers
                in education as well as the teachers own comfort with computers and their ability to use them all as
                result
                in varying effectiveness in the integration of ICT in the classroom.

                There is some evidence that, to be effective in education, ICT must be fully integrated into the
                pedagogy.
                Specifically, when teaching literacy and math, using ICT in combination with Writing to Learn
                produces better results than traditional methods alone or ICT alone.
