        <br>
        <p>Autonomous driving is already a hot topic, although level 5 (fully autonomous) has not been realized. Some
            Tesla cars can be switched to autopilot mode on the highway, but this is only possible up to level 2
            (driving support) or level 3 (operated by the driver in an emergency).

            Technology for understanding detailed road conditions by AI is evolving. Startups Prophesee (France),
            Perceptive Automata (U.S.), and Humanising Autonomy (U.K.) stand out as leaders. They will contribute
            towards achieving level 5 in 2020.

            <p class="lead " style="text-align:justify">A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle (AV),
                connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV), driverless car, robo-car, or robotic car, is a vehicle
                that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.

                Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as radar, lidar,
                sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.[1] Advanced control systems interpret sensory
                information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant
                signage.

                Long-distance trucking is seen as being at the forefront of adopting and implementing the
                technology..,According to a 2020 study, self-driving cars will increase productivity, and housing
                affordability, as well as reclaim land used for parking. However, self-driving cars will cause
                greater energy use, traffic congestion and sprawl.

                According to a 2020 Annual Review of Public Health review of the literature, self-driving cars "could
                increase some health risks (such as air pollution, noise, and sedentarism); however, if proper
                regulated, AVs will likely reduce morbidity and mortality from motor vehicle crashes and may help
                reshape cities to promote healthy urban environments.
