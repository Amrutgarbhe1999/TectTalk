        <p class="my-2">Nanotechnology (or "nanotech") is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and
            supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology[1][2] referred to the
            particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale
            products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology
            was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the
            manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects
            the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition
            shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and
            technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It
            is therefore common to see the plural form "nanotechnologies" as well as "nanoscale technologies" to refer
            to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size.

                Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to
                create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine,
                nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand,
                nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the
                toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics,
                as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among
                advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.
                Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of science as diverse as
                surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage,
                microfabrication, molecular engineering, etc. The associated research and applications are equally
                diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon
                molecular self-assembly,from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct
                control of matter on the atomic scale.
