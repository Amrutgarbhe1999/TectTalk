                <p class="lead">(AI)
                    Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in recent years, but it continues
                    to be a trend to watch because its effects on how we live, work, and play are only in the early
                    stages. In addition, other branches of AI have developed, including Machine Learning, which we will
                    go into below. AI refers to computer systems built to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks
                    such as recognition of images, speech or patterns, and decision making. AI can do these tasks faster
                    and more accurately than humans.

                    Five out of six Americans use AI services in one form or another every day, including navigation
                    apps, streaming services, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps, home personal
                    assistants, and smart home devices. In addition to consumer use, AI is used to schedule trains,
                    assess business risk, predict maintenance, and improve energy efficiency, among many other
                    money-saving tasks.

                    AI is one part of what we refer to broadly as automation, and automation is a hot topic because of
                    potential job loss. Experts say automation will eliminate 73 million more jobs by 2030. However,
                    automation is creating jobs as well as eliminating them, especially in the field of AI: Pundits
                    predict that jobs in AI will number 23 million by 2020. Jobs will be created in development,
                    programming, testing, support, and maintenance, to name a few. Artificial Intelligence architect is
                    one such job. Some say it will soon rival data scientists in need of skilled professionals. To learn
                    more about potential jobs in AI, read about building a career in AI, or why you should earn an AI
                    certification.</p>

                    </span></h2>Machine Learning is a subset of AI. With Machine Learning, computers are programmed to
                learn to do
                something they are not programmed to do: they learn by discovering patterns and insights from data. In
                general, we have two types of learning, supervised and unsupervised.

                While Machine Learning is a subset of AI, we also have subsets within the domain of Machine Learning,
                including neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning. Each of these subsets
                offers an opportunity for specializing in a career field that will only grow.

                Machine Learning is rapidly being deployed in all kinds of industries, creating a huge demand for
                skilled professionals. The Machine Learning market is expected to grow to $8.81 billion by 2022. Machine
                Learning applications are used for data analytics, data mining, and pattern recognition. On the consumer
                end, Machine Learning powers web search results, real-time ads, and network intrusion detection, to name
                only a few of the many tasks it can do.

                In addition to completing countless tasks on our behalf, it is generating jobs. Machine Learning jobs
                rank among the top emerging jobs on LinkedIn, with almost 2,000 job listings posted. And these jobs pay
                well: In 2017, the median salary for a machine learning engineer was $106,225. Machine Learning jobs
                include engineers, developers, researchers, and data scientists.

                    </span></h2>
                <p class="lead"> Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology
                    that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as
                    interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails.
                    RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the menial tasks of a
                    low-paid worker: up to 45 percent of the activities we do can be automated, including the work of
                    financial managers, doctors, and CEOs.

                    Although Forrester Research estimates RPA automation will threaten the livelihood of 230 million or
                    more knowledge workers or approximately 9 percent of the global workforce, RPA is also creating new
                    jobs while altering existing jobs. McKinsey finds that less than 5 percent of occupations can be
                    totally automated, but about 60 percent can be partially automated.

                    For you as an IT professional looking to the future and trying to understand technology trends, RPA
                    offers plenty of career opportunities, including developer, project manager, business analyst,
                    solution architect, and consultant. And these jobs pay well. SimplyHired.com says the average RPA
                    salary is $73,861, but that is the average compiled from salaries for junior-level developers up to
                    senior solution architects, with the top 10 percent earning over $141,000 annually. </p>

                    </span></h2>Virtual Reality (VR) immerses the user in an environment while Augment Reality (AR)
                enhances their environment. Although VR has primarily been used for gaming thus far, it has also been
                used for training, as with VirtualShip, a simulation software used to train U.S. Navy, Army, and Coast
                Guard ship captains. The popular Pokemon Go is an example of AR.

                Both VR and AR have enormous potential in training, entertainment, education, marketing, and even
                rehabilitation after an injury. Either could be used to train doctors to do surgery, offer museum-goers
                a deeper experience, enhance theme parks, or even enhance marketing, as with this Pepsi Max bus shelter.

                There are major players in the VR market, like Google, Samsung, and Oculus, but plenty of startups are
                forming and they will be hiring, and the demand for professionals with VR and AR skills will only
                increase. Getting started in VR doesn’t require a lot of specialized knowledge. Basic programming skills
                and a forward-thinking mindset can land a job, although other employers will be looking for optics as a
                skill-set and hardware engineers as well.

                <p class="lead"> Cybersecurity might not seem like emerging technology, given that it has been around for a while,
                    but it is evolving just as other technologies are. That’s in part because threats are constantly
                    new. The malevolent hackers who are trying to illegally access data are not going to give up any
                    time soon, and they will continue to find ways to get through even the toughest security measures.
                    It’s also in part because new technology is being adapted to enhance security. As long as we have
                    hackers, we will have cyber security as an emerging technology because it will constantly evolve to
                    defend against those hackers.</p>
