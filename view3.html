        <br>
        <p>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence
            demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI
            textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment
            and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term
            "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions
            that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

            As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from
            the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[3] A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is
            whatever hasn't been done yet. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from
            things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally
            classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in
            strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in
            content delivery networks, and military simulations.

            <p class="lead " style="text-align:justify"> A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that
                maximize its chance of success. An AI's
                intended utility function (or goal) can be simple ("1 if the AI wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise") or
                complex ("Perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past"). Goals can be
                explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for "reinforcement learning", goals can be
                implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.[a] Alternatively, an
                evolutionary system can induce goals by using a "fitness function" to mutate and preferentially
                replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such
                as finding food. Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these
                systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training
                data. Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose
                "goal" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.

                AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a
                mechanical computer can execute. A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler,
                algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play
