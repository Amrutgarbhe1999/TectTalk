                <p class="lead">Heated seats have been around for quite some time now, but that doesn’t make them any
                    less awesome. Few sensations rival the warm embrace of heated leather around your backside in
                    winter, except perhaps a cooled one in summer. Add in a massage function and you’ll be happy as a
                    clam.

                    Though the 1972 Saab 99 is sometimes credited with offering the first heated seats, Cadillac
                    actually made the feature available on the Fleetwood luxury car in 1966. The option was quite rare,
                    though, and warmth was distributed via carbon-cloth heating pads. Whomever is responsible, our lower
                    backs collectively thank you.

                    </span></h2>The next feature we’ve chosen to honor is much more modern one — adaptive cruise control
                (ACC). Systems can vary from automaker to automaker, but all ACCs use some sort of radar/camera system
                to track the vehicles ahead and adjust speed accordingly. While regular cruise control holds the car at
                a steady velocity until the driver intervenes, ACC will speed up or slow based on the position of the
                cars in front, reducing fatigue. Some will even bring you a complete stop when necessary, allowing the
                driver to set off again with a quick touch of the “Resume” button. For best results, pair with lane
                keeping assist for a stress-free ride.

                Completely autonomous cars are still years away, but semi-autonomous features like this are a glimpse
                into a driverless future.

                    </span></h2>
                <p class="lead">We’re approaching a time where old-fashioned car keys will go the route of the floppy
                    disc — obsolete, clumsy, and forgotten. Most new cars offer an electronic key fob as opposed to a
                    standard key, which allows drivers to lock, unlock, and start their vehicle from afar. And with
                    their proximity sensors, fobs can automatically unlock a car’s door when the driver touches the
                    handle, which is handy when you have bags, children, animals, or bags of children and animals in
                    your hands.

                    Once inside, you’ll find yet another function made possible by the key fob —push-button start. Not
                    only is keyless ignition the biggest advancement in vehicle starting technology since, well, the
                    key, it immediately increases the perceived value of the car. Just hit the switch and go.

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Automatic <span class="text-muted">parking
                    </span></h2>Automatic parking is the answer to an age-old question — why do it when your car can do
                it for you? The technology started popping up in the United States in the early 2000s, mostly notably in
                2006 with the Lexus LS460. With sonar sensors and a rearview camera working in concert, the luxury sedan
                could parallel park almost completely by itself, with the driver using only the brake to stop once
                signaled to do so. Lexus had started a trend.

                Ever since, manufacturers like Ford, Audi, Jeep, BMW, and more have flirted with autonomous parking
                systems, and this year Tesla unveiled a Summon feature that allows Model S and Model X drivers to park
                their vehicles remotely with their key fob. Imagine a future where you pull up to a restaurant, hop out
                of the driver’s seat, and watch your car autonomously scoot away in search of parking. When you’re done,
                it zips right back to you like a loyal pet, waiting to take you back home. That future isn’t far away
                now, and for that, we give thanks.

                    </span></h2>
                <p class="lead">Electric cars are great for the environment and the wallet, but long charging times
                    initially made road trips impractical. Enter DC fast charging, which dramatically reduces charging
                    times compared to conventional AC charging systems. While 240-volt Level 2 AC systems take hours to
                    recharge an electric car, many DC fast-charging stations can recharge a battery pack to 80 percent
                    capacity in around 30 minutes.

                    DC fast charging still has a long way to go. The stations themselves are relatively expensive and
                    thus less common than AC stations. There are also three competing standards (CHAdeMO, CCS, and
                    Tesla’s Supercharger) which means not every electric car can charge at every station. Regardless,
                    we’re thankful for the progress made so far.</p>
